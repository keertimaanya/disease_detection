# Uber Ride Cancellation Prediction

This project predicts whether an Uber ride will be **canceled or completed** based on factors like user rating, driver rating, time of day, ride demand, and past cancellations. A **Random Forest Classifier** is trained for predictions, and an interactive **Streamlit web app** allows real-time testing.

## Project Overview
The project analyzes Uber ride cancellations using **Machine Learning** and provides an **interactive web-based prediction tool**. The model learns from historical ride data and predicts if a ride will be canceled.

### Features:
- Predicts **ride cancellations** based on real-world-like factors.
- Provides **data insights** via visualizations.
- Web app built with **Streamlit** for real-time predictions.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - **Data Handling**: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn`
  - **Visualization**: `matplotlib`
  - **Web App Deployment**: `streamlit`
  - **Model Saving**: `joblib`

---

## Dataset
- **Number of Records**: 90,000 (synthetic)
- **Features:**
  - `user_rating` → Passenger's Uber rating (1.0 - 5.0)
  - `driver_rating` → Driver's Uber rating (1.0 - 5.0)
  - `time_of_day` → Time of the ride (`morning`, `afternoon`, `evening`, `night`)
  - `ride_demand` → Ride demand (`low`, `medium`, `high`)
  - `past_cancellations` → Number of past canceled rides
  - `cancellation` → **Target Variable** (0 = Not Canceled, 1 = Canceled)

---

## Model Performance
- **Algorithm Used**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: ~85%
  - **AUC-ROC Score**: ~0.88
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identifies key factors impacting ride cancellations.
